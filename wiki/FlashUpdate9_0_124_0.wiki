#summary Issue on Flash Player update 9,0,124,0 (FMS3.0.1)

= Issue on Flash Player update 9,0,124,0 (FMS3.0.1) =

== The Issue ==

If you play with new Flash Player 9,0,124,0, you can't see any video streaming served by RubyIZUMI. It seems some change on RTMP handshake.

== Bypassing Handshake to FMS3.0.1 ==

The following code i wrote is to pass through handshake to FMS3 (RTMP::Session#handshake, The address ”1.2.3.4” is FMS3 Edge IP address) . If you use this patch, you can play with 9,0,124,0 :)

{{{
def handshake
  s = TCPSocket.open(”1.2.3.4”, 1935)
  @sock.read(1)
  s.write(”\3”)
  d1 = @sock.read(HandshakeSize)
  s.write(d1)
  s.read(1)
  @sock.write(”\3”)
  d2 = s.read(HandshakeSize)
  d3 = s.read(HandshakeSize)
  @sock.write(d2)
  @sock.write(d3)
  @sock.read(HandshakeSize)
  s.close
  IzumiLogger.debug ”<> handshaked 3.0.1”
end
}}}

 * d1: Flash Player -> RubyIZUMI (Client request?)
 * d2: RubyIZUMI -> Flash Player (Server response?)
 * d3: RubyIZUMI -> Flash Player (???)

== Tried some times using this code and i found: ==
 * *d3 can not equal d1 (9,0,115,0 or older version can equal these)*
 * d1 and d2 seems contain uptime in first 4byte (I guess the other bytes are generate this value)
 * d3 seems simply random ;)
